Homework 01: Code Refactor
README

According to the README in the homework, this README requires three aspects: "description, screenshot, and link to deployed application"



Section 1: Description

    This assignment was decently simple.  The main portion was understanding all the code as if we had written it.  You needed to understand it this well in order to see where it could be streamlined without making actual changes to the page.  The biggest things that I remember streamlining were the list of links in the header and the two sections (left and right) of the main content below the header and background image.  These portions of the css included a lot of useless syntax.  I cleared all the useless stuff away and left only what was necessary.  During this I also reorganized the code so that it was structed logically based on the visual flow of the website.
    
    Step 2 was to increase the accessibility of the page by adding alt links to all the images.  Very simple to do: just add an alt="" filled with a decent description of the image.

    Step 3 was to add a title.  I based mine off of a real website for a company my friend works for: Equipment Share.  Equipment Share's homepage (https://www.equipmentshare.com/) has a title: "Equipment Share | Build With Control".  Build with control is the companies slogan.  Since I do not know of a slogan for Horiseon, I simply replaced that with homepage.  My pages title is "Horiseon | Homepage".  Looks sleek so I kept it.

    Step 4 was to fix the links in the header of the page.  They were already working properly, they just didn't lead anywhere.  The assignment didn't say where they should lead to, so I just made them links to google searches of the corresponding words.  I also made them open in a new tab simply because I prefer links to do that.  I also noticed that thet links would adjust to a wrong position if the screen size was too small.  I fixed that.

    Step 5 was to make a git repository for this assignment since I hadn't done that yet.  I also had to set up the live website.

    Step 6 was to comment everything.  I did the HTML even though nothing said to.  It just seemed right to do.  I did the CSS as well (which we were explicitly told to do).  I'm not sure on what comments should look like.  I did my best while trying not to overdo it.  Trying to balance readability with adjustability for future changes to the code.  During this I noticed one more css thing I hadn't correctly placed in the logical place and fixed it.

    Step 7 was to commit those changes and then start writing this README.
